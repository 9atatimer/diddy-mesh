# Diddy-Mesh Architecture

## Overview

Diddy-Mesh implements a distributed service mesh architecture optimized for Cloudflare Workers, using a combination of edge routing, service discovery, and observability components that operate within Cloudflare's global network.

## Core Components

### 1. Service Registry
- **Location**: Cloudflare KV Store or Durable Objects
- **Purpose**: Maintains service endpoints and health status
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic service registration
  - Health checking
  - Version-aware routing
  - Geographic distribution awareness

### 2. Edge Router
- **Location**: Embedded in each Worker
- **Purpose**: Routes requests between services
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent load balancing
  - Circuit breaking
  - Retry policies
  - Traffic splitting for A/B testing

### 3. Observability Layer
- **Location**: Distributed across Workers
- **Purpose**: Provides monitoring and tracing
- **Features**:
  - Request tracing
  - Metrics collection
  - Error tracking
  - Performance monitoring

### 4. Configuration Manager
- **Location**: Cloudflare KV Store
- **Purpose**: Manages mesh configuration
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic routing rules
  - Security policies
  - Rate limiting configuration
  - Feature flags

## Data Flow

```
Client Request
    ↓
Cloudflare Edge
    ↓
Worker A (with Diddy-Mesh)
    ↓
Service Discovery Query
    ↓
Target Worker B Selection
    ↓
Request Routing + Observability
    ↓
Worker B Response
    ↓
Response to Client
```

## Service Discovery

### Registration Process
1. Worker starts and registers with Service Registry
2. Health check endpoint exposed
3. Service metadata stored (version, capabilities, regions)
4. Periodic health updates sent

### Discovery Process
1. Service requests target service from registry
2. Registry returns available endpoints
3. Load balancer selects optimal endpoint
4. Request routed to selected service

## Traffic Management

### Load Balancing Strategies
- **Geographic**: Route to nearest available service
- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly
- **Weighted**: Route based on service capacity
- **Least Connections**: Route to least busy service

### Circuit Breaking
- Monitor service health and response times
- Automatically fail fast when services are unhealthy
- Gradual recovery with exponential backoff

### Retry Logic
- Configurable retry policies per service
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Circuit breaker integration

## Security Model

### Authentication
- Worker-to-Worker authentication using Cloudflare API tokens
- Optional mTLS for enhanced security
- Service identity validation

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Service-to-service permissions
- Request-level authorization policies

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit by default
- Secure storage of configuration in KV
- Audit logging for security events

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Tree-shaking to eliminate unused code
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Efficient serialization formats

### Execution Time Limits
- Async operations for non-critical paths
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Optimized algorithms for routing decisions

### Memory Constraints
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient data structures
- Garbage collection friendly patterns

## Deployment Model

### Worker Integration
```javascript
import { DiddyMesh } from 'diddy-mesh';

const mesh = new DiddyMesh({
  serviceName: 'user-service',
  version: '1.0.0',
  registry: 'kv',
  observability: true
});

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return mesh.handle(request, {
      // your handler logic
    });
  }
};
```

### Configuration Example
```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "user-service": {
      "endpoints": ["worker1.example.workers.dev"],
      "healthCheck": "/health",
      "timeout": 5000,
      "retries": 3
    }
  },
  "routing": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "path": "/api/users/*",
        "service": "user-service",
        "loadBalancer": "geographic"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
