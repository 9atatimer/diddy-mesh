# Diddy-Mesh Context

## Project Overview

Diddy-Mesh is a lightweight service mesh designed specifically for Cloudflare's edge computing environment, targeting Cloudflare Workers and Pages projects. Unlike traditional service meshes that operate in containerized environments, Diddy-Mesh is optimized for the unique constraints and capabilities of Cloudflare's serverless platform.

## Problem Statement

Modern applications increasingly adopt microservices architectures, but Cloudflare Workers and Pages lack the service mesh capabilities that facilitate secure, observable, and reliable service-to-service communication. Traditional service meshes like Istio or Linkerd are designed for Kubernetes environments and are too heavyweight for Cloudflare's edge computing model.

## Solution Approach

Diddy-Mesh provides:

- **Lightweight Architecture**: Minimal overhead suitable for Cloudflare Workers' execution constraints
- **Edge-Native Design**: Built specifically for Cloudflare's global edge network
- **Serverless Optimization**: No persistent infrastructure required
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple configuration and deployment

## Key Differentiators

1. **Edge-First**: Leverages Cloudflare's global network for service discovery and routing
2. **Zero Infrastructure**: No control plane deployment required
3. **Sub-millisecond Latency**: Minimal performance impact on Worker execution
4. **Bundle Size Optimized**: Efficient code splitting and tree-shaking
5. **Workers API Integration**: Native integration with Cloudflare Workers APIs

## Target Use Cases

- Microservices running on Cloudflare Workers
- API gateways and proxies
- Edge computing applications
- Jamstack applications on Cloudflare Pages
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications
- Real-time applications requiring low latency

## Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on request latency
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and failover
- **Observability**: Built-in logging and metrics
- **Security**: Secure by default with optional mTLS
- **Flexibility**: Configurable routing and policies
