# Diddy-Mesh

A lightweight service mesh specifically designed for Cloudflare Workers and Pages environments.

## Overview

Diddy-Mesh provides service mesh capabilities optimized for Cloudflare's edge computing platform, enabling secure, observable, and reliable service-to-service communication without the complexity and overhead of traditional service mesh solutions.

## Key Features

- **üåç Edge-Native**: Built specifically for Cloudflare's global edge network
- **‚ö° Lightweight**: Minimal impact on Worker execution time and bundle size
- **üîÑ Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and discovery using Cloudflare KV
- **üéØ Intelligent Routing**: Geographic and performance-based load balancing
- **üìä Observability**: Built-in monitoring, tracing, and metrics collection
- **üîí Security**: Optional mTLS, authentication, and authorization
- **üõ°Ô∏è Resilience**: Circuit breaking, retries, and graceful degradation
- **‚öôÔ∏è Zero Infrastructure**: No control plane deployment required

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install diddy-mesh
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { DiddyMesh } from 'diddy-mesh';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    const mesh = new DiddyMesh({
      serviceName: 'user-service',
      version: '1.0.0',
      registry: env.KV_NAMESPACE,
      observability: true
    });

    return mesh.handle(request, {
      '/api/users': () => handleUsers(request),
      '/api/health': () => new Response('OK')
    });
  }
};
```

### Service Configuration

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "user-service": {
      "endpoints": ["https://users.example.workers.dev"],
      "healthCheck": "/health",
      "timeout": 5000,
      "retries": 3
    },
    "order-service": {
      "endpoints": ["https://orders.example.workers.dev"],
      "loadBalancer": "geographic"
    }
  },
  "routing": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "path": "/api/users/*",
        "service": "user-service"
      },
      {
        "path": "/api/orders/*",
        "service": "order-service"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Architecture

Diddy-Mesh implements a distributed architecture using Cloudflare's edge infrastructure:

- **Service Registry**: Stores service metadata in Cloudflare KV Store
- **Edge Router**: Embedded in each Worker for intelligent request routing
- **Observability Layer**: Distributed monitoring and tracing across Workers
- **Configuration Manager**: Dynamic configuration using Cloudflare KV

For detailed architecture information, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Use Cases

- **Microservices on Workers**: Connect and manage multiple Cloudflare Workers
- **API Gateways**: Intelligent routing and load balancing for API endpoints
- **Edge Computing**: Low-latency service communication at the edge
- **Jamstack Applications**: Service mesh for Cloudflare Pages with API routes
- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: Secure service isolation and routing

## Performance

Diddy-Mesh is optimized for Cloudflare Workers constraints:

- **Bundle Size**: < 50KB gzipped impact
- **Cold Start**: < 10ms initialization overhead
- **Request Latency**: < 1ms routing decision time
- **Memory Usage**: < 1MB runtime footprint

## Comparison with Traditional Service Meshes
